Abstract:
This study aimed to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the quality of red wine based on numerous physicochemical properties. A dataset containing information about the physical and chemical properties of red wines, along with their respective quality ratings, was used to train and test several machine learning algorithms. After evaluating multiple models using pycaret and scikit-learn libraries of Python, a Voting Classification approach utilizing Random Forest and XGBoost stood out as the top performer, achieving an outstanding accuracy of 86.09%.
The precision, recall, and F1 metrics further indicated that this model excelled in identifying positive instances while limiting false positives. To make the model accessible to users, it was implemented using Render and FastAPI and hosted on GitHub Pages, allowing individuals to easily predict the quality of red wine by entering relevant parameter values. Overall, this study indicates the potential of machine learning techniques in accurately forecasting the quality of red wine, thereby helping informed industry decision-making.
